          <h2>Average <span class="socio_text">Socioeconomic</span> Insights</h2>
          <p>This comprehensive dataset presents an interesting socioeconomic overview of Malaysia from 1980 to 2016. 
            These insights are derived from meticulous annual data collection, made publicly available by the <i>Government of Malaysia</i>.
            The dataset delves into critical aspects of the country's well-being, such as <b>"<span class="density_text">Population Density</span>, <span class="unemployment_text">Unemploymnt Rate</span> and
            <span class="crime_text">Crime Rates</span>"</b> which have been carefully analysed for each of Malaysia's distinct local states.</p>

            <p><b>**NOTE:</b> <span class="gray_text"> Gray</span> states means the data is unavailable.</p>
          </div>

          <p>Socioeconomic statistics in Malaysia vary from each states between the East Malaysia and West Malaysia,
            where the States that has the highest average of <b>"Population Density"</b> (Penang) and 
            <b>"Crime Rates"</b> (Selangor) lies in the West Malaysia. In the other hand, East Malaysia holds the lowest average of both 
            <b>"Population Density"</b>(Sarawak) and <b>"Crime Rates"</b>(Sabah).

          <p>The chart above illustrates the correlation between Unemployment Rate, Crime Rate, and Density.
              It appears that states with higher unemployment rates tend to have higher crime rates, 
              although this relationship is not very strong. Population density is also a factor in the visualization,
              and it's worth noting that states with better crime rates do not necessarily have lower population densities.
              This suggests that the key to maintaining lower crime rates may depend on factors such as education,
              job opportunities, and government initiatives aimed at addressing these issues

          <h2>Statewise Crime Trends</h2>
          <p>Crime statistics in Malaysian states have been fluctuating over the years.
            Notably, Selangor consistently reported the highest crime rates. 
            However, a positive trend emerged in 2007, with crime rates declining in most states.
            This shift towards safer communities is aligned with improved law enforcement strategies,
            community policing, public awareness, and collaborative efforts.</p>

          <h2>Changes in Unemployment Rate</h2>
          <p>One interesting trend is that bullying rates have decreased across the years in all regions and genders.
            Of note is that the bullying rate in boys is now 1.9% lower than that in girls, despite starting 2.2% higher.
            This change occurred between 2010 and 2011. We speculate that this may be due to the popularisation of social media
            around this time, allowing for different avenues of bullying, such as cyberbullying, to emerge. </p>
